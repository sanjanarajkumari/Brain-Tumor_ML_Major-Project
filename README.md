# Brain-Tumor_ML_Major-Project
This project is based on Image Classification of Brain Tumor using Machine learning Algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM) 

This project classifies various brain tumors under the labels namely
Meningioma Tumor
Pituitary Tumor
Glioma Tumor
No Tumor

The project takes an image of the various brain tumors MRI applies Support Vector
Algorithm on it and classifies in into any of the 4 labels.
